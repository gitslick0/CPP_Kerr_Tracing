The code was originally made public under this link: https://www1.ynao.ac.cn/~yangxl/yxl.html .
The link no longer works (for unknown reasons) but the source code can still be found via the wayback machine.
For preservatory/recreatability reasons this repository is used to preserve the original YNOGK code at the Remeis observatory (as some work at the observatory is based on this code)
